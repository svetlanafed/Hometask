You tried to hold me down, so I became a soldier
Built up all these walls, and now I’m climbing over
Those nasty bees are temping me, oh, lord
But I ain’t going back
You take me for a fool, that doesn’t make me foolish
Told me I was wrong, passion made you ruthless
Manipulate, it’s just too late, oh, lord
'Cause I ain’t going back no more
You’re fueling up the flames
Gonna show you what I’m made of
Breaking every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn’t change, but I grew on ya
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
Making me believe I couldn’t do without ya
Make it hard to leave, you think it’s all about ya
You know I’ll never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire
I tried to get this weight off of my shoulders
Built up all my strength, I’m finally taking over
Complicate, I don’t appreciate, oh lord
'Cause I ain’t going back no more
You’re fueling up the flames
Gonna show you what I’m made of
Breaking every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn’t change, but I grew on ya
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
Making me believe I couldn’t do without ya
Make it hard to leave, you think it’s all about ya
You know I’ll never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
Keeping me alive
Keeping me alive
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
Breaking me, shaking me, shaping me into what I never wanted, oh
Breaking me, shaking me, making my beating heart a little stronger
Stronger, strong, baby
Breaking every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn’t change, but I grew on ya
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
Breaking every chain that you put on me
You thought I wouldn’t change, but I grew on ya
'Cause I will never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
Making me believe I couldn’t do without ya
Make it hard to leave, you think it’s all about ya
You know I’ll never be what you wanted
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
Keeping me alive
Keeping me alive
This fire, this fire, this fire is keeping me alive
